# dockerjenkins
This is the necroscope repo for a jenkinsfile the runs a docker image.  Requires the docker plugin in jenkins
Note this is good for large process jobs that require many running containers and many jenkins nodes.
I have another version I use it for python data analysis...but the setup here is to just show a gradle build.
You can take it from there.


Requires:
jenkins version 2.1.X
docker pipline  1.1.x
docker commons plugin 1.15.x


Enjoy!
The Necroscope
