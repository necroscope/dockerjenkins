# dockerjenkins
This is the necroscope repo for a jenkinsfile that runs a docker image.  It requires the docker plugin in jenkins.
Please note this is a good template for large process jobs that require many running containers and many jenkins nodes.
I have another version that I use for python data analysis...but the setup here is to just show a gradle build across
several docker nodes.

You can take it from here.....


Requires:
- jenkins version 2.1.X
- docker pipline  1.1.x
- docker commons plugin 1.15.x


Enjoy!
The Necroscope
